# **Solder Reflow Plate - 70mm by 50mm Ver 3.0 ATmega4809**

## How-To - Programming the Board
This Solder Reflow Plate has been specifically designed to be Arduino based and easily programmed through the Arduino IDE or any other similar environment.
For ease, here is a guide to programming the board via the Arduino IDE.
The ATmega4809 is UPDI programmed. Once the boards arrive and I have experienced this myself I will write up a full guide. In the meantime there are a few good guides out there on UPDI programming from an Arduino.
