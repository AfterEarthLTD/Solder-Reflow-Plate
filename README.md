# **Solder Reflow Plate**

###### By AfterEarth Ltd

This is a largely unmodified version of the design by AfterEarthLTD that was also seen on a [GreatScott! video](https://github.com/DerSpatz/PCB-reflow-solder-heat-plate). I have made some tweaks to the software to get it to work on the ATMega4809 and also added instructions on how to build it and program it. It does work, but there are some problems with the design. I am working on newer designs but the best design out there today is probably the one by [DerSpatz](https://github.com/DerSpatz/PCB-reflow-solder-heat-plate)

## WARNING!!!

This design lacks safety features to limit the amount of power it may draw or the temperature it may reach and there are other issues with the electrical design. With a suitable power supply and as long as the software doesn't have any major bugs, it can be operated without issue but there is a real risk that it could start a fire in the event of a software bug or other fault. Do not leave it unsupervised while connected to power.

Checkout the new Ver 3.0 design. Very similar to Ver 2.4 but now comes with ATmega4809 as its availability is much better than the 328p at the moment. Code is still in development but the board designs are available in the Board Versions Folder.

## Versions

- 70mm x 50mm (Ver 2.4)
  - 12VDC (5A Minimum)
  - 5.5mm x 2.5mm Barrel Jack
  - 0.91" OLED Display
  - ATmega328p Microprocessor

- 70mm x 50mm (Ver 3.0) **NEW**
  - 12VDC (5A Minimum)
  - 5.5mm x 2.5mm Barrel Jack
  - 0.91" OLED Display
  - ATmega4809 Microprocessor

## About the Project

Like any good nerd does I've been expanding my hobby horizons.
I've gone from breadboard, to perf board, through-hole, to SMD, ever increasing circuit complexity and improving my knowledge.
But I've become frustrated with the difficulty of SMD soldering.
Regular soldering jogs small components and needs lots of flux.
Hot air damages plastics.
Hot plates are expensive and can be big wastes of space.

*"But you're a nerd"* I hear you cry, *"why don't you DIY a solution?"*.

[Electronoobs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjiVhIvGmRZixSzupD0sS9Q) shows a great DIY solution using an old clothes iron hot plate.
You can watch his video [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7blZigaaaA)
Have a go!

While I love this solution, I wanted to develop something smaller and more permanent.
Hence the Solder Reflow Plate was born, a PCB-based, MOSFET controlled heater, perfect for easily reflowing SMD components giving surprisingly professional results. Furthermore, these results are achieved without breaking the bank or taking up an enormous amount of desk space.

And so, this nerd bestows upon the world his project, fully open-source and hackable.
Here's hoping that it may be used to develop skills, build custom circuit boards, and make quality designs possible to all!

## Purchase

- Register your email address at [www.solderreflowplate.co.uk](https://www.solderreflowplate.co.uk) to know when it is available to buy!
- There is a worldwide shortage of ATmega328p Microcontrollers. I'm currently working on a small redesign for a more readily available chip.
- Purchase will be available soon!
