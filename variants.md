# Board variants

The populatiry of the project has prompted other tinkerers to design their own variants of this hardware.
Inovation and experimentation is always encouraged in projects such as this one, but too many alternatives and an variations in desing can make it difficult to find which one fit one's needs best.
The bellow table acts as an index/catalog of all variants, helpfully adding some text.
